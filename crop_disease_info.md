Apple Scab
Definition: Apple Scab is a serious fungal disease affecting apple and crabapple trees, caused by the fungus *Venturia inaequalis*. The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground and releases spores in the spring, which are then spread by wind and rain to new leaves, flowers, and fruit. The disease thrives in cool, wet conditions, making early spring a critical period for infection. Severe infections can lead to significant defoliation, reducing the tree's vigor and yield for the current and subsequent seasons.
Symptoms: Initial symptoms appear as light green, almost velvety spots on the leaves, which darken to an olive-green or brown color as they mature.||Infected leaves may become twisted and puckered before turning yellow and dropping prematurely.||On fruit, the spots are initially brown and corky, which can lead to cracking and distortion as the fruit grows, making it susceptible to secondary infections.||Flower stems can also be infected, causing the blossoms to drop.
Precautions: The most effective preventative measure is to plant apple varieties that are resistant to Scab.||Thoroughly rake up and destroy all fallen leaves in the autumn to eliminate the primary source of fungal spores for the following season.||Prune trees annually to maintain an open canopy, which improves air circulation and allows foliage to dry more quickly after rain, reducing the window for infection.||Avoid overhead irrigation, as wet leaves create a favorable environment for fungal growth.
Treatment and Remedies: Begin applying fungicides in the spring, from the green tip stage of bud development through early summer.||For conventional treatment, fungicides containing myclobutanil, captan, or mancozeb are effective. Always alternate fungicides to prevent resistance.||For organic approaches, use fungicides based on sulfur, copper, or potassium bicarbonate. Neem oil can also be effective as a preventative spray.

Apple Black Rot
Definition: Apple Black Rot is a fungal disease caused by *Botryosphaeria obtusa*. This pathogen can infect the fruit, leaves, and bark of apple trees. It often enters the tree through wounds from pruning, insects, or hail. The disease is most severe in regions with warm, humid summers. If left unmanaged, it can cause significant fruit loss and weaken the tree over time by creating cankers on the branches.
Symptoms: The most classic symptom is "frog-eye leaf spot," which starts as small purple specks on leaves and enlarges into circular lesions with a tan or brown center and a purple border.||On fruit, the rot typically begins at the blossom end, appearing as a small, brown, firm spot that enlarges and turns black, often in a series of concentric rings.||Infected fruit will eventually shrivel into a hard, black "mummy."||On branches, the disease causes sunken, reddish-brown cankers that can girdle and kill the limb.
Precautions: Practice meticulous orchard sanitation by pruning out dead or diseased branches and removing mummified fruit from the tree and the ground.||Maintain tree health with proper fertilization and watering to improve its natural defenses against infection.||Protect the tree from unnecessary wounds and apply protective paint to large pruning cuts.
Treatment and Remedies: During the dormant season, prune out all cankered wood, cutting at least a few inches into healthy tissue.||Apply appropriate fungicides (e.g., captan, thiophanate-methyl) starting from the silver tip stage through the summer, following a consistent spray schedule.

Cedar Apple Rust
Definition: A complex fungal disease caused by *Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae*, which requires two different host plants to complete its life cycle: an apple or crabapple tree and a juniper or Eastern red cedar. The fungus produces galls on the juniper host, which release spores in the spring that infect apple trees. While rarely fatal to apples, it can significantly reduce fruit quality and yield.
Symptoms: On apple leaves, the first sign is small, pale yellow spots that enlarge to a bright orange-yellow, often with a reddish border.||Tiny black dots (spermogonia) may appear in the center of the leaf spots.||On the underside of the leaves, small, tube-like structures (aecia) may form later in the season.||Infected fruit may be stunted and deformed with raised orange lesions.
Precautions: The most effective control is to break the disease cycle by not planting junipers near apple trees (ideally a separation of at least a mile).||If possible, remove any nearby volunteer cedar trees.||If junipers are present, inspect them for the brown, woody galls and remove them before they can produce spores in the spring.||Apply preventative fungicides from the pink bud stage of apple development until about 30 days after petal fall.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicides such as myclobutanil or mancozeb are highly effective when applied preventatively. For organic control, sulfur-based sprays can offer some protection.

Apple (Healthy)
Definition: A healthy apple tree exhibits strong, vigorous growth with no signs of disease or pest-related stress. The foliage is lush and appropriately colored for the variety, and the tree is capable of producing a full crop of high-quality fruit.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress, such as spots, lesions, or mold.||Leaves are a vibrant green, fully expanded, and free of discoloration or curling.||Fruit is smooth, unblemished, and develops to a proper size and color.||Bark is intact without cankers or unusual growths.

Blueberry (Healthy)
Definition: A healthy blueberry plant is characterized by vigorous growth, abundant foliage, and the production of plump, properly colored berries. It shows no signs of common blueberry diseases like mummy berry, anthracnose, or rust.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress.||Leaves are a lush, deep green (or reddish in the fall, depending on the variety) and free of spots.||Berries are plump, uniform in size and color, and have a healthy "bloom" (waxy coating).||Canes are strong and free of cankers or lesions.

Cherry (including sour) Powdery Mildew
Definition: A fungal disease caused by *Podosphaera clandestina* that affects cherries. It appears as distinctive white, powdery patches on leaves and fruit. The fungus thrives in warm, humid conditions and can spread rapidly, affecting photosynthesis and reducing fruit quality.
Symptoms: White, powdery patches of fungal growth appear on both the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, as well as on young shoots and fruit.||Infected leaves may become distorted, curled, or stunted.||Fruit that is infected may have rough, russeted patches and can be of poor quality.
Precautions: Prune trees to promote good air circulation, which helps reduce humidity within the canopy.||Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as this encourages a flush of succulent new growth that is highly susceptible to infection.||Planting cherry varieties with genetic resistance to powdery mildew is a highly effective long-term strategy.
Treatment and Remedies: At the first sign of disease, apply fungicides. Organic options include sulfur, potassium bicarbonate, or neem oil.||For conventional control, fungicides like myclobutanil or propiconazole are effective. It's important to start applications early and maintain coverage during periods of high disease pressure.

Cherry (including sour) (Healthy)
Definition: A healthy cherry tree is characterized by strong annual growth, deep green, glossy leaves, and the production of glossy, well-formed fruit. The tree is free from common cherry ailments like brown rot, bacterial canker, or powdery mildew.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress.||Leaves are glossy, deep green, and show no signs of spotting or curling.||Fruit is plump, unblemished, and has a bright, uniform color.||The trunk and branches are free from cankers or oozing sap (gummosis).

Corn (maize) Cercospora Leaf Spot (Gray Leaf Spot)
Definition: A significant fungal disease of corn caused by *Cercospora zeae-maydis*. The disease reduces the photosynthetic capacity of the leaves, which can lead to reduced grain fill and weaker stalks, making the plant more susceptible to lodging. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often more severe in fields with continuous corn planting and conservation tillage.
Symptoms: The disease produces long, narrow, rectangular lesions that are tan or grayish in color and run parallel to the leaf veins.||Lesions begin on the lower leaves and progressively move up the plant as the season advances.||In severe infections, the lesions can merge, causing large areas of the leaf to wither and die, giving the plant a scorched appearance.
Precautions: Planting corn hybrids with high levels of genetic resistance is the most effective management tool.||Rotate crops with non-host crops like soybeans or alfalfa to break the disease cycle.||Managing crop residue through tillage can help reduce the amount of fungal inoculum that overwinters in the field.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicides can be effective, particularly when applied at the first sign of disease on susceptible hybrids in high-risk environments (e.g., humid weather, no-till fields). Applications are most beneficial when made between the tasseling and silking growth stages.

Corn (maize) Common Rust
Definition: A fungal disease of corn caused by *Puccinia sorghi*. While it is common, it is generally less damaging than other corn diseases unless the infection is severe on a susceptible hybrid. The fungus produces characteristic cinnamon-brown, powdery pustules on the leaves.
Symptoms: Small, cinnamon-brown, powdery pustules (uredinia) appear on both the upper and lower leaf surfaces.||The pustules are circular to elongate in shape.||Severe infections can cause the leaves to yellow and die prematurely, which can impact grain fill.
Precautions: The primary method of control is planting resistant corn hybrids. Most modern hybrids have good to excellent resistance.||Fungicide applications are generally not economically justified unless the infection is unusually severe on a highly susceptible variety.
Treatment and Remedies: In most cases, no treatment is necessary due to the high levels of resistance in modern corn hybrids. Fungicides are available but are typically reserved for high-value sweet corn or seed production fields.

Corn (maize) Northern Leaf Blight
Definition: A major fungal disease of corn worldwide, caused by *Exserohilum turcicum*. The disease produces large, distinctive cigar-shaped lesions on the leaves, which can significantly reduce photosynthesis and, consequently, grain yield, especially if the infection occurs before or during tasseling.
Symptoms: The disease is characterized by long, elliptical, grayish-green or tan lesions on the leaves.||These lesions can be from 1 to 6 inches long and have a distinctive "cigar" shape.||Under moist conditions, the lesions may have a dark, fuzzy appearance due to fungal sporulation.||Severe infections can lead to the loss of significant foliage.
Precautions: Planting resistant hybrids is the most effective and economical way to manage Northern Leaf Blight.||Crop rotation and tillage to bury infected residue can help reduce the initial inoculum for the next season's crop.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicides can provide good control if applied at the first sign of disease, especially when weather conditions favor disease development. Timing is critical, with applications around the tasseling stage being most effective at protecting yield.

Corn (maize) (Healthy)
Definition: A healthy corn plant is strong and vigorous, with broad, green leaves, a sturdy stalk, and is on track to produce well-developed ears of corn. It shows no signs of lesions, rust, stunting, or nutrient deficiencies.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress.||Leaves are broad, vibrant green, and stand erect.||The stalk is sturdy and thick, capable of supporting the plant.||Silks and tassels appear healthy during the reproductive stages.

Grape Black Rot
Definition: A severe fungal disease of grapes caused by *Guignardia bidwellii*. It is particularly problematic in warm, wet climates. The disease can infect all green parts of the vine, including leaves, shoots, and fruit, and can lead to a total loss of the crop if not controlled.
Symptoms: On leaves, it begins as small, circular, reddish-brown spots that enlarge and turn black, often with tiny black dots (pycnidia) in the center.||On fruit, the infection starts as a small, pale spot that quickly engulfs the entire berry.||Infected berries turn from brown to black, shrivel, and become hard, wrinkled "mummies." These mummies are a key source of spores for the next season.
Precautions: During dormancy, prune the vines to improve air circulation and remove any visible cankers on the canes.||Diligently remove and destroy all mummified berries from the vine and the ground to reduce the disease reservoir.||Choosing grape varieties that are less susceptible to Black Rot can significantly reduce disease pressure.
Treatment and Remedies: A rigorous fungicide spray schedule is often necessary for control in susceptible regions. Applications should start in early spring as new shoots emerge and continue until the grapes begin to ripen. Fungicides like mancozeb and myclobutanil are effective.

Grape Esca (Black Measles)
Definition: A complex and destructive fungal disease of grapevines, often referred to as a "disease complex" because it involves several different fungi. Esca can manifest in a chronic form, weakening the vine over many years, or an acute form (apoplexy), which can kill the vine very suddenly. It affects the wood, leaves, and fruit.
Symptoms: On berries, it causes small, circular, dark spots, often surrounded by a brown or purple ring, resembling "black measles."||The leaves develop a characteristic "tiger-stripe" pattern, with yellowing (in white varieties) or reddening (in red varieties) between the green veins.||Internally, the woody trunk will show signs of rot when cut, which is a key diagnostic feature.||In the acute form, a large portion or the entire vine will suddenly wilt and die in mid-summer.
Precautions: Management is difficult. Practice good sanitation and prune out and destroy any visibly infected or dead wood.||Avoid making large pruning cuts during wet weather, as this creates an entry point for the fungi.
Treatment and Remedies: Currently, there is no chemical cure for Esca. The primary management strategy is surgical: carefully pruning out the infected parts of the vine to try to save the remaining healthy sections.

Grape Leaf Blight (Isariopsis Leaf Spot)
Definition: A fungal disease caused by *Pseudocercospora vitis*. While generally considered less severe than diseases like Black Rot or Downy Mildew, it can cause premature defoliation, which weakens the vine and can affect fruit ripening and winter hardiness.
Symptoms: The disease produces irregular, dark brown to black spots on the leaves.||These spots often have a darker border and may feel slightly raised.||As the spots merge, they can cause large areas of the leaf to become necrotic (die).||Infected leaves may drop from the vine prematurely.
Precautions: After the leaves have fallen in autumn, rake and destroy them to reduce the source of fungal spores for the next season.||Promote good air circulation through proper pruning and canopy management techniques, such as leaf pulling in the fruit zone.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicide sprays that are applied to control other, more serious grape diseases will typically provide excellent control of Leaf Blight as well. Specific treatment is often not required.

Grape (Healthy)
Definition: A healthy grapevine is characterized by vigorous growth, a full canopy of large, green leaves, and the development of well-formed grape clusters. It is free from spots, mold, mildew, or any other signs of disease.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress.||Leaves are large, uniformly green, and fully expanded.||The developing grape clusters are free from spots or rot, and the berries are sizing up properly.||The canes are healthy and show strong annual growth.

Orange Haunglongbing (Citrus Greening)
Definition: A devastating bacterial disease of citrus trees caused by the bacterium *Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus*. The disease is spread by a tiny insect called the Asian citrus psyllid. Citrus Greening is one of the most serious citrus diseases in the world, as there is no cure, and infected trees will eventually die. It disrupts the flow of nutrients in the tree, leading to the characteristic symptoms.
Symptoms: The most telling symptom is blotchy, mottled leaves with an asymmetrical yellowing pattern.||Infected trees often have yellow shoots amidst otherwise green foliage.||The fruit is small, misshapen, and often remains partially green even when ripe.||The juice from affected fruit has a bitter, salty taste.||Over time, the tree will experience severe twig and limb dieback.
Precautions: The primary strategy is aggressive control of the Asian citrus psyllid population using targeted insecticides.||It is critical to remove and destroy infected trees immediately to prevent them from serving as a source of the bacteria for psyllids to spread to other healthy trees.||When planting new trees, only purchase certified disease-free nursery stock from reputable sources.
Treatment and Remedies: There is no cure for Citrus Greening. Once a tree is infected, it cannot be saved and will decline until it dies. All management efforts are focused on preventing the spread of the disease.

Peach Bacterial Spot
Definition: A bacterial disease caused by *Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni*, which affects peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums. The disease thrives in warm, rainy weather and can cause significant damage to both the leaves and the fruit, leading to defoliation and making the fruit unmarketable.
Symptoms: On leaves, it begins as small, angular, water-soaked spots that turn purple and then brown to black.||The dead tissue around the leaf spots may drop out, giving the leaf a "shot-hole" appearance.||On fruit, the spots are circular and often become pitted or cracked as the fruit expands.||Severe infections can lead to premature defoliation, which weakens the tree.
Precautions: Planting peach varieties that are resistant to Bacterial Spot is the most effective long-term control strategy.||Avoid planting trees in poorly drained or low-lying areas where air circulation is poor.||Apply protective bactericides, typically copper-based, starting from the shuck split stage of fruit development.
Treatment and Remedies: Control can be very difficult, especially in seasons with frequent rainfall. Copper-based bactericides can help suppress the disease but must be applied carefully to avoid damaging the foliage. Oxytetracycline is another antibiotic that can be used.

Peach (Healthy)
Definition: A healthy peach tree shows vigorous growth, has a full canopy of vibrant green leaves, and is producing juicy, well-formed peaches. It is free from common peach diseases like bacterial spot, brown rot, or peach leaf curl.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress.||Leaves are a vibrant green and show no signs of spots, holes, or curling.||The fruit has smooth, unblemished skin and is developing normally.||The trunk and branches are free from cankers or signs of insect borers.

Bell Pepper Bacterial Spot
Definition: A common and often destructive bacterial disease of peppers and tomatoes, caused by several species of *Xanthomonas*. The bacterium can be introduced on contaminated seed and then spreads rapidly in warm, wet conditions through splashing rain or overhead irrigation. It can cause significant defoliation and render the fruit unmarketable.
Symptoms: On leaves, the spots start as small, water-soaked areas that turn dark brown to black and become angular in shape.||The center of the spots may dry up and fall out.||Severe infections cause the leaves to turn yellow and drop from the plant.||On the fruit, the spots are initially small, circular, and water-soaked but become raised, brown, and scab-like.
Precautions: The most important preventative step is to use certified disease-free seed and transplants.||Practice crop rotation, avoiding planting peppers or tomatoes in the same spot for at least one to two years.||Avoid working in the fields when the plants are wet, as this can easily spread the bacteria.||Switch from overhead irrigation to drip irrigation to keep the foliage dry.
Treatment and Remedies: Preventative applications of copper-based bactericides can help manage the disease, though their effectiveness can be limited once the disease is established, especially in rainy weather. Some strains of the bacterium have developed resistance to copper.

Bell Pepper (Healthy)
Definition: A healthy bell pepper plant is robust and green, with a full canopy of large, glossy leaves. It is actively flowering and producing smooth, well-shaped peppers that are free from any spots, lesions, or signs of sunscald.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress.||Leaves are large, glossy, and a deep green color.||The peppers are smooth, unblemished, and developing a uniform shape and color.||The plant is upright and shows no signs of wilting.

Potato Early Blight
Definition: A common fungal disease of potatoes and tomatoes caused by *Alternaria solani*. Despite its name, Early Blight often appears later in the growing season, particularly after the plants have flowered. It typically affects the lower, older leaves first and progresses up the plant. The disease is favored by warm weather with periods of rainfall or high humidity.
Symptoms: The classic symptom on leaves is the appearance of small, dark, circular lesions that often have a characteristic "target spot" or "bull's-eye" pattern of concentric rings.||A narrow yellow halo may surround the lesions.||As the lesions enlarge, they can cause the entire leaf to turn yellow and die.||The disease can also cause dark, sunken, circular lesions on the potato tubers.
Precautions: Plant only certified disease-free seed potatoes to avoid introducing the pathogen.||Rotate crops, ensuring potatoes or tomatoes are not planted in the same field for at least two years.||Keep the foliage as dry as possible by watering at the base of the plant, preferably in the morning so the leaves can dry during the day.||Maintain good plant nutrition, as stressed plants are more susceptible.
Treatment and Remedies: Apply fungicides such as chlorothalonil or mancozeb when the disease first appears. For effective control, applications need to be repeated every 7-10 days, especially if weather conditions favor the disease.

Potato Late Blight
Definition: A devastating disease of potatoes and tomatoes caused by the oomycete (a water mold) *Phytophthora infestans*. This is the disease responsible for the historic Irish potato famine. Late Blight can spread with incredible speed in cool, wet weather, and can completely destroy a crop within a week or two if left unchecked.
Symptoms: The disease appears as large, dark green to black, water-soaked lesions on the leaves and stems.||A key diagnostic feature is the presence of a white, downy mold on the underside of the leaves at the edge of the lesions, especially in the morning when humidity is high.||Infected tubers develop a reddish-brown, dry rot that extends from the skin into the flesh.
Precautions: The most critical step is to plant only certified disease-free seed potatoes.||Destroy any volunteer potato plants that grow from tubers left in the field from the previous year, as well as any cull piles of discarded potatoes, as these are major sources of infection.||Allow for good air circulation by properly spacing plants.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicides are essential for managing Late Blight. Preventative applications are far more effective than trying to stop an established infection. Fungicides should be applied before the disease is spotted, especially when weather forecasts predict cool, wet conditions.

Potato (Healthy)
Definition: A healthy potato plant has a lush, green canopy of foliage above ground and is developing firm, healthy, unblemished tubers below ground. It is free from common potato diseases like blight, scab, or viral infections.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress.||The foliage is lush, green, and shows no signs of lesions, yellowing, or wilting.||When harvested, the tubers are firm, have smooth skin, and are free from spots, blemishes, or rot.

Raspberry (Healthy)
Definition: A healthy raspberry plant consists of strong, vigorous canes (primocanes and floricanes), vibrant green leaves, and is producing plump, brightly colored berries. It is free from common raspberry diseases like cane blight, rust, or viral diseases.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress.||The canes are strong, upright, and free from lesions or unusual growths.||The leaves are a vibrant green and show no signs of mottling, mosaic patterns, or rust pustules.||The berries are plump, brightly colored, and free from mold.

Definition: A healthy soybean plant is well-developed, with a full canopy of green, trifoliate leaves, and is actively producing pods filled with developing soybeans. The plant is free from common soybean diseases such as frogeye leaf spot, rust, or sudden death syndrome.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress.||The leaves are uniformly green and free from spots or lesions.||The plant has a well-developed root system with active nitrogen-fixing nodules.||The pods are filling out properly and show no signs of discoloration or disease.

Squash Powdery Mildew
Definition: A very common fungal disease that affects all members of the cucurbit family, including squash, pumpkins, cucumbers, and melons. It appears as distinctive white, powdery spots on the leaves and stems. While it rarely kills the plant outright, it can reduce photosynthesis, stress the plant, and lead to a smaller harvest and lower fruit quality.
Symptoms: The disease is easily identified by the white, powdery spots of fungal growth on the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves, as well as on petioles and stems.||As the disease progresses, the spots can merge, covering the entire leaf surface.||Infected leaves may turn yellow, then brown, and die.||The disease can also cause premature ripening of the fruit.
Precautions: Plant squash varieties that are advertised as being resistant to powdery mildew.||Provide good air circulation by spacing plants properly to reduce humidity.||Water the soil at the base of the plant rather than watering the leaves.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicides are most effective when applied at the very first sign of disease. Organic options include potassium bicarbonate, neem oil, or sulfur-based sprays. For conventional control, a variety of fungicides are available and should be used in rotation to prevent resistance.

Strawberry Leaf Scorch
Definition: A common fungal disease of strawberries caused by *Diplocarpon earlianum*. The disease produces distinctive purplish spots on the leaves. As the disease progresses, the spots enlarge, and the tissue between them turns reddish-purple, giving the leaf a "scorched" appearance. While it primarily affects the leaves, it can weaken the plant and reduce yield.
Symptoms: The disease begins as small, irregular, deep purplish spots on the leaves.||These spots enlarge, and the tissue between them turns reddish-purple or brown, making the leaf look like it has been scorched by fire.||In severe cases, the edges of the leaves may curl upwards, and the leaves may dry up and die.
Precautions: Planting resistant strawberry varieties is the best way to manage the disease.||After harvesting the strawberries, mow and remove the old, infected leaves to reduce the amount of inoculum for the next season.||Ensure good air circulation and sunlight penetration by maintaining a proper plant density.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicide applications can be effective but should be applied before the disease becomes severe. Fungicides used to control other strawberry leaf diseases will also typically control Leaf Scorch.

Strawberry (Healthy)
Definition: A healthy strawberry plant is characterized by a vibrant crown of green leaves and the production of plump, red, juicy strawberries. It is free from common strawberry problems like leaf spots, fruit rot (gray mold), or pest damage.
Symptoms: No visible signs of disease or distress.||The leaves are a vibrant, glossy green and show no signs of spots or discoloration.||The strawberries are plump, fully colored red, and free from any mold, soft spots, or other blemishes.

Tomato Bacterial Spot
Definition: A bacterial disease caused by *Xanthomonas* species that affects tomatoes and peppers. The bacterium causes small, water-soaked, dark spots on leaves, stems, and fruit. The disease is spread by splashing water and can be very destructive in warm, humid conditions, causing significant defoliation and making the fruit unmarketable.
Symptoms: On leaves, the spots are small, dark, angular, and appear water-soaked.||On fruit, the spots are slightly raised, circular, and have a scabby texture.||Infected leaves often turn yellow and drop from the plant, which can expose the fruit to sunscald.
Precautions: Use only certified disease-free seed and transplants to avoid introducing the pathogen.||Rotate crops, ensuring tomatoes or peppers are not planted in the same area for at least a year.||Avoid overhead watering; use drip irrigation to keep the leaves dry.
Treatment and Remedies: Control is very difficult. Copper-based bactericides can provide some suppression if applied preventatively, but their effectiveness is limited, especially in wet weather.

Tomato Early Blight
Definition: A very common fungal disease of tomatoes caused by *Alternaria solani*. The disease creates distinctive dark lesions, often with a "bull's-eye" pattern, on the lower leaves, stems, and fruit. It typically starts on the lower, older foliage and progresses up the plant. While it can occur at any time, it is most common in mid to late summer.
Symptoms: The classic symptom is the appearance of dark, circular lesions on the leaves, which often have a "bull's-eye" pattern of concentric rings.||A yellow halo often surrounds the lesions.||The disease can also cause large, dark, sunken lesions on the stem end of the fruit.||Severe infections can cause significant defoliation, starting from the bottom of the plant.
Precautions: Mulching around the base of the plants can reduce the splash of fungal spores from the soil onto the lower leaves.||Water at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry.||Prune the lower leaves as the plant grows to improve air circulation and remove the most likely source of initial infection.
Treatment and Remedies: Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or mancozeb at the first sign of disease and continue on a 7-10 day schedule.

Tomato Late Blight
Definition: A highly destructive disease of tomatoes and potatoes caused by the oomycete *Phytophthora infestans*. It can spread with extreme rapidity in cool, wet weather and can destroy an entire crop in a very short time. The spores are easily spread by wind and rain.
Symptoms: The disease appears as large, dark green to black, water-soaked spots on the leaves and stems.||A key diagnostic sign is the presence of a fuzzy white mold on the underside of the leaves at the edge of the lesions.||On the fruit, the disease causes large, firm, brown, greasy-looking lesions.
Precautions: Plant tomato varieties that have resistance to Late Blight.||Allow for plenty of space between plants to promote air circulation and quick drying of leaves.||Monitor local agricultural reports, as outbreaks are often tracked and reported.||If you spot the disease, destroy the infected plants immediately to prevent it from spreading.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicides must be applied preventatively in areas where Late Blight is common, especially when cool, wet weather is forecast. It is very difficult to stop the disease once it has started.

Tomato Leaf Mold
Definition: A fungal disease caused by *Passalora fulva* (formerly *Fulvia fulva*) that primarily affects tomatoes grown in greenhouses or other high-humidity environments. It causes pale green or yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface and a velvety, olive-green mold on the lower surface.
Symptoms: The first signs are pale green or yellowish spots on the upper surface of the leaves, with indefinite borders.||The corresponding lower surface of the leaf will show a velvety, olive-green to brownish mold.||As the disease progresses, the infected leaves will turn yellow, then brown, and drop from the plant.
Precautions: The most effective control is to use tomato varieties that are resistant to Leaf Mold.||In a greenhouse environment, ensure good ventilation and low humidity to create conditions that are unfavorable for the fungus.||Space plants far enough apart to promote good air circulation.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicides can be used, but the primary focus should be on environmental control and resistant varieties.

Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot
Definition: A very common fungal disease of tomatoes caused by *Septoria lycopersici*. The disease creates numerous small, circular spots with dark borders and tan centers on the lower leaves. The spots are often so numerous that they can cause the leaves to yellow, die, and fall off, which can weaken the plant and lead to sunscald on the fruit.
Symptoms: The disease is characterized by numerous small, circular spots on the leaves, typically about 1/8 inch in diameter.||The spots have dark brown borders and lighter tan or gray centers.||A key diagnostic feature is the presence of tiny black dots (pycnidia), which are the spore-producing structures of the fungus, in the center of the spots.||The disease starts on the lower leaves and progresses up the plant.
Precautions: Mulch around the base of the plants to create a barrier between the soil and the leaves.||Water at the base of the plant to avoid wetting the foliage.||Remove the most heavily infected lower leaves to reduce the amount of fungal inoculum.||Practice crop rotation.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicides containing chlorothalonil or mancozeb are effective. Applications should begin when the disease is first noticed and continue throughout the season.

Tomato Spider Mites (Two-spotted spider mite)
Definition: This is not a disease but rather damage caused by a common pest, the two-spotted spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*). These tiny arachnids feed on the sap of the plant cells, causing a fine, yellowish stippling on the leaves. They thrive in hot, dry conditions.
Symptoms: The first sign of damage is a fine, yellowish stippling or speckling on the leaves.||As the infestation worsens, the leaves may turn yellow or bronze and become dry.||In severe infestations, fine webbing will be visible on the undersides of the leaves and between the stems, which is a tell-tale sign of spider mites.
Precautions: Keep plants well-watered, as water-stressed plants are more susceptible to spider mites.||Regularly inspect the undersides of the leaves for the presence of mites or their webbing.||Encourage natural predators like ladybugs and predatory mites, which feed on spider mites.
Treatment and Remedies: For minor infestations, a strong spray of water can dislodge many of the mites.||Insecticidal soap or horticultural oil sprays are effective at controlling spider mites, but they require thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of the leaves. For severe infestations, a dedicated miticide may be necessary.

Tomato Target Spot
Definition: A fungal disease caused by *Corynespora cassiicola*. It creates small, water-soaked spots on the leaves that enlarge into lesions with light tan centers and dark borders, often with concentric rings that resemble a target. The disease can also affect stems and fruit and can cause significant defoliation.
Symptoms: The lesions on the leaves have light tan centers and dark borders, often with concentric rings, giving them a "target spot" appearance.||The spots can also appear on stems and fruit.||Severe infections can lead to significant defoliation, which weakens the plant and exposes the fruit to sunscald.
Precautions: Improve air circulation through proper spacing and pruning of the plants.||Practice crop rotation to reduce the buildup of the fungus in the soil.||Mulch around the base of the plants to prevent soil splash.
Treatment and Remedies: Fungicides containing chlorothalonil or mancozeb are effective against Target Spot and should be applied when conditions are favorable for the disease.

Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
Definition: A devastating viral disease that is transmitted by the silverleaf whitefly. Once a plant is infected, it is severely stunted, and its leaves become small, curl upwards, and turn yellow between the veins. The disease can dramatically reduce or eliminate fruit production.
Symptoms: The most prominent symptoms are the severe stunting of the plant and the upward curling of the leaves.||The leaves will be small and have a distinctive yellowing between the veins.||Infected plants may produce very few flowers or fruit, and any fruit that is produced is often small and of poor quality.
Precautions: The primary method of control is to manage the whitefly population. This can be done using reflective mulches, insecticidal soaps, or targeted insecticides.||Use tomato varieties that are advertised as being resistant to the virus (TYLCV-resistant).||Remove and destroy any infected plants immediately to prevent them from acting as a source of the virus for whiteflies to spread.
Treatment and Remedies: There is no cure for an infected plant. All management efforts must focus on prevention and controlling the whitefly vector.

Tomato Mosaic Virus
